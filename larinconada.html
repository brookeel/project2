            <p>The town of La Rinconada may just be the most secluded place in the world in regards to height. This town of 16,000 is located in the Andes Mountains of Peru and sits at 16,700 feet above sea level! The incredible elevation makes La Rinconada the highest permanent town in the world. </p>
            <p>The town itself varies from 16,100 to 16,700 feet above sea level, depending on where you are. Regardless, you are guaranteed to be over 3.0 miles above sea level, no matter where you are! With the extreme elevation, no trees grow in the area. The area is built around local mines, and the rising price of gold has caused La Rinconada to grow in recent years.</p>
