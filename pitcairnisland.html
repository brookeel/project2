            <p>The remote island chain of Pitcairn is famous for being the least populous national jurisdiction in the world. This tiny volcanic island chain is located in the south Pacific. One of the most famous islands of the four total is Easter Island, well-known for the large head sculptures that are scattered throughout. </p>
            <p>Incredibly, the islandâ€™s population is recognized as an ethnic group directly descended from mutineers aboard the HMS Bounty in 1789. The last known record was taken in January 2020, resulting in 47 known permanent inhabitants. The original inhabitants of the island were Polynesians who likely left around the 15th century.</p>
