            <p>The small island chain of Tristan da Cunha is on our list as the most remote place in the world. It is officially listed as the most remote inhabited archipelago in the world, with the closest settlement located 1,514 miles away. The islands are located in the south Atlantic Ocean. </p>
            <p>Tristan da Cunha is an island chain, although there is only one primary island that people inhabit. Currently, around 250 people live on the 38 square mile island and are considered citizens of the British Overseas Territories. Inhabitants are 1,732 miles (2,787 km) from the coast of Cape Town in South Africa, 1,514 miles (2,437 km) from Saint Helena, and 2,487 miles (4,002 km) off the coast of the Falkland Islands. Additionally, the island doesnâ€™t have an airstrip. In order to get to Tristan da Cunha, a six-day boat trip is required from South Africa.</p>
