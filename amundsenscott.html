            <p>The Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station may just be the most remote location on our list! As a secondary point, it is likely the most secluded place on Earth. What makes this location so interesting is that it isn’t actually a town or settlement but a research base located in the center of Antarctica. </p>
            <p>The Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station is owned by the United States and is the most southern thing under the jurisdiction of the United States, although it isn’t under the sovereignty of the States. The station is so far south that it is the only inhabited place on Earth where the sun is entirely visible for six months and totally dark for six months.</p>
