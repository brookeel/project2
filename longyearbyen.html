            <p>The town of Longyearbyen is known as the world’s most northernmost settlement (with a population greater than 1,000). It is located on Svalbard, a Norwegian-owned archipelago between mainland Norway and the North Pole. The land is mostly uninhabited and is home to glaciers, polar bears, and Svalbard reindeer. </p>
            <p>Longyearbyen translates to “The Longyear Town,” and it was established in 1906 by the Arctic Coal Company. Due to its isolation, Longyearbyen is home to the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, a vault that acts as a secure backup of the world’s crop diversity in case of a worldwide catastrophic failure.</p>
