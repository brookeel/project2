            <p>Although Oymyakon isn’t the most remote place in the world, it is certainly the coldest! Oymyakon is officially the coldest permanently inhabited settlement on Earth. This small locality is located in the far northeast of Russia, deep in Siberia. The town is named after the Oymyakon River, which likely comes from the Even language, meaning “unfrozen patch of water” and “place where fish spend the winter.” </p>
            <p>The temperatures of Oymyakon have reportedly reached as low as −96.2 °F. The only colder temperatures in the world are in Antarctica, with a recorded −128.6 °F.</p>
