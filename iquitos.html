            <p>The second town we’ve looked at in Peru, Iquitos isn’t as high or far away as some other places in the world, but it is really inaccessible! Iquitos is known as being the largest city in the world that cannot be reached by road. </p>
            <p>The city is the 9th most populous city in Peru and the largest metropolis in the Peruvian Amazon. The only ways you can reach Iquitos are by plane and boat. Iquitos has been inhabited for a very long time, mostly by indigenous people groups. The surrounding jungle makes travel to this city impossible by anything but boats and planes. As such, Iquitos serves as the port city to the deep jungle and tribal villages of the northern Amazon region.</p>
