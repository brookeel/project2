            <p>The world often feels like it’s getting smaller each day, especially as technology continues to connect us. Still, despite the leaps and bounds of human ingenuity, there are places in the world that are so remote that few people even know they exist. These remote places are some of the most interesting and harsh environments on the planet. Even a plane ticket isn’t enough to get you to most of these destinations. Let’s get started! </p>
            <p>We’ve found 8 of the most secluded places on Earth, each with their own rationale as to why they made it on our list. Some are tiny island paradises, while others are remote and frigid landscapes. What makes them similar is their extreme remoteness from human civilization, plus their secluded nature. People live at each of these locations, even to this day. Let’s take a look at these wild spots. Click on an image to go directly to a page about that location, or click the arrow to view this article like a slide show!</p>
