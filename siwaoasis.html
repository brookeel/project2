            <p>Egypt has massive stretches of desert within its borders. The Siwa Oasis isn’t super remote, at least by distance to civilization. It is, however, totally cut off from almost all modern civilization and development, primarily due to its location. </p>
            <p>Siwa Oasis is located in the deep regions of the Sahara and often hits temperatures as high as 115°F. People have lived around this oasis since 10,000 BC, mostly because of the 200 freshwater springs that are spread across the small area. The region is accessible, but it is essentially a step back in time as you walk through kershif buildings.</p>
